# MA tool


The tool has functionality similar to  Hudl/Ubersense, Coach Eye, V1 sport, etc., and does not require installation of any software.
It is just single web page, so  does not have anything installed but a web browser.

I created it thinking why previous webinar MA sessions were unsuccessful. 
With my web page you can email me just one link, and then you can  discuss MA with me even by land phone, and we will see with no delay the same pic on our PC having nothing but a web browser.

The main features are:

1. It has two youtube video players with buttons to play each of the two video with 5 different speeds or frame-by-frame, independently or synchronously.
2. In process of preparation to MA session you create two playlists: for left video player (e.g. skier to analyze, or "bad skiing") and for right video player (e.g. perfect skiing) in MS Excel or Google Spreadsheet,
and list of moments for comparison on left and right video players.

You can copy-paste these lists from your MS Excel or Google Spreadsheet to two tables on the MA-tool page above the players, and use controls between the tables and the video players to go through the list of the points.

3. You can make a comments about  Ski-Snow interaction, body movements, prescriptions under the video players and then transfer it to table to save them using a button right of the comments.

4. You can insert there list of links to youtube video, and then use the video in the tool.
5. You draw lines and dots over the video.
6. Full Screen for each video with all controls 
7. Phase matching (e.g. bm3 = "show myself vs. all great skiers  - from Back - at Medium Turn - 3 o'clock position")  .
